# Portfolio website

This is a website built by me to showcase my work and skills in a welcoming way.

If you've reached this repository and have any suggestions, questions or work, reach me @ the handles below.

## Workflow

This is reflected in my commits on this repository, but for the most part:

-   Brainstorming the initial design in a tool like [`Figma`](https://www.figma.com), I believe, is the best way to start a project. It's very fast to iterate and the project's goals will be clear from the beginning.

-   The next logical step is to declare all the elements and position them around the page on desktop and mobile until they're similar to the design.

-   The styling process usually takes the longest since ideas can still creep up even after the design phase, otherwise it's just a matter of matching the project with the design file.

-   The next longest part is implementing code features, especially for websites with a heavy backend, but fortunately in this case there's no backend needed.

## My choice of libraries

I use [`SvelteKit`](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/) for all my personal projects and wherever else possible.

I find they are the easiest to iterate after you've mastered the basics. This makes me be able to handle both big and small projects for clients by myself or in small teams.

### TailwindCSS

This library does make it a bit more cumbersome to modify styles once they are in place but I find it to be very manageable when using a frontend library.

The same component rarely repeats since it's either placed in a different file or it's iterated multiple times straight in the frontend library. After I've used it for a while I'm even able to react to feedback live for most of the final touches.

### SvelteKit

Even though it is rather fresh I haven't encountered a problem it can't solve in a scalable way.

### Conclusion

So far these two in combination not only give me incredible development speed, they have also been an appreciated solution for all the developers I've shared them with and they have helped me cooperate in small teams without any conflicts.
