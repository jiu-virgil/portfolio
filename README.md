# Portfolio website

This is a website built by me to showcase my work and skills in a welcoming way.

If you've reached this repository and have any suggestions, questions or work, reach me @ the handles below.

## Workflow

-   In my opinion the best way to build a website is to brainstorm a design using a tool like [`Figma`](https://www.figma.com) to get some barebones looking good. Take breaks, think the design again, eventually scrap it if it doesn't feel satisfying anymore

-   After the design feels good, I start implementing the body and some basic positioning so all the elements are in place

-   The styling process usually takes the longest since ideas can still creep up even after the design phase

-   In case styling has been a breeze, then the next longest part is implementing code features, but fortunately in this case there's no backend needed

## My choice of libraries

I use [`SvelteKit`](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/) for all my personal projects and wherever else possible.

I find they are the easiest to iterate after you've mastered the basics. This makes me be able to handle both big and small projects for clients by myself.

### TailwindCSS

It does make it a bit more cumbersome to modify styles once they are in place but I find it to be very manageable when using a frontend library.

The same component rarely repeats since it's either placed in a different file or it's iterated multiple times straight in code and after I've used it for a while I'm even able to react to feedback live for most final touches.

### SvelteKit

Even though it is rather fresh I haven't encountered a problem it can't solve in a scalable way.

### Conclusion

So far these two in combination not only give me incredible development speed, they have also been an appreciated solution for all the developers I've shared them with and they have helped me cooperate in small teams without any conflicts.
